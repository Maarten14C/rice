# to do: move calib.t function from clam to rice, enhance plotting when y<=130, remove clutter by using calibrate()

# can calibrate() get a draw=TRUE option? No, for that we have caldist

# should glue.ccurves and mix.ccurves also go into rice? Future work on mix.ccurves. But best keep within rintcal for purposes of backward compatability, and since it is closest related to calibration curves rather than e.g. calibration.
