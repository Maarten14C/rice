# to do: 

# load only the most relevant rice functions into rbacon, rplum
# check how only relevant functions from the rintcal package can be loaded. This also because rice will be loaded by clam, rbacon, rplum, coffee

# add F.cc curve to work in F

# add data from historical UBA standards/backgrounds?

# terr-marine contribution calculation

# AMS background and fractionation corrections

# add 'realm' to calibrate function? Perhaps better not, since then the date would also have to be on that realm
