# This is the first release of the rice package. It separates existing functions from the rintcal package by the same author, aiming to transform rintcal into a data package whereas rice will be under more development. New functions have been added. The separation aims to reduce CRAN's data burden of hosting multiple updates to the rintcal package without changes in the data of said package.
